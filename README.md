Hello there!

This project is an Expense Tracker project which has been curated under the internship of Code Alpha by Sania Verma. 
This project deals with user input like expense name, amount and the date of expense and calculates the total expenses. This
can be a great way to manage and keep track of your expenses. You can also delete a value from the table.
